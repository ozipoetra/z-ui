# X-UI ENGLISH VERSION

Another Translated-to-English Version of X-UI; with some of more advanced features implemented. 
 
All feature is Based from [NidukaAkalanka](https://github.com/NidukaAkalanka/x-ui-english) and
kind a fork from [taffychan's x-ui](https://github.com/taffychan/x-ui) + [hossinasaadi's x-ui](https://github.com/hossinasaadi/x-ui), which all are forked from [vaxilu's awesome project](https://github.com/vaxilu/x-ui/) : a Multi-protocol Multi-user Xray Panel

---

<b>Note:</b> I just customize the X-ui service name with z-ui and Xray service name to another, for those who know and needed that ðŸ˜‰. All credit is belong of them in above.
